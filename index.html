           <li> <p><b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>, born on <i>April 14, 1891</i>, in Mhow, India, overcame significant social discrimination to excel academically, earning degrees from <strong> Columbia University</strong> and the <strong> London School</strong> of Economics. </p></li>

Notable among these are the <em>Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University in Aurangabad</em> and <em>the Ambedkar Institute of Technology in Bangalore.</em></p></li>
       <li><p>Ambedkar envisioned a society where the principles of <u>justice, equality, and fraternity</u> would be central.

       <li><p> Ambedkar authored several important works, including<mark> “Annihilation of Caste,”</mark> which criticizes the Hindu caste system and calls for its labolition. His writings continue to be studied and revered for their insight into<i> social and political issues.</i></p></li>
    <li><p><i>In 1932,</i> Ambedkar negotiated the <strong>Poona Pact with Mahatma Gandhi</strong>, which led to the allocation of reserved seats for Dalits in <em>legislative bodies</em> while addressing Gandhi’s concerns about separate electorates.</p></li>
